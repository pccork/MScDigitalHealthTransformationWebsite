    <h1 id="section-1">Chronic Renal Disease</h1>
    <p>With around 12% of the population in Ireland developing chronic renal disease (CRD) and around 40% of detection rate only around 3% of patients
      with CRD will finally develop End stage renal failure (ESRF). Chronic renal disease CRD is a collection of syndromes that lead to the decrease of renal functions.

    </p>
    <p>CRD is a very common complication in type II diabetic patients, and the pathological connection between CRD and type II diabetes is very complex.
      It could be summarised as uncontrolled high glucose in the blood causing damage to the capillary of the kidneys; which can lead to renal damage and hypertension.
        Most CRD patients could be managed effectively in the primary care setting without referring to the secondary care centres in hospitals.
        Primary care CRD management includes lifestyle changes, and medications to control blood pressure and blood glucose levels.
        Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are important to prevent or slow down the progression of CRD.

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
  
    <h1 id="section-2">Prognosis of CKD</h1>
    <p>Indicators are showing the progression of CRD and require referral to secondary care treatment.  
      The two most dominant ones are estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR and Urine Albumin creatinine ratio ACR.
      Abnormal results caused by the reduced ability to remove waste and the leaking of a protein called albumin indicating kidney damage
      And the combination of these two factors is used to stage the development of renal disease.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
    <h1 id="section-3">Kidney Failure Risk Equation</h1>
    <p>In addition to eGFR and ACR, Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) has also been included as an important indicator (NG203).
      KFRE is a well-documented and validated prediction equation which could evaluate the risk of developing end-stage renal disease ESRD within the next five years.

    </p>
    <p>The referral criteria include: </p>
    <p>KFRE over 5% and or with the following indicators: </p>
    <p>. Rapid decrease of eGFR within a short period of time </p>
    <p>. Increase of ACR over 30 mg/mmol and haematuria </p>
    <p>. ACR over 70 mg/mmol and not due to diabetes or diabetes with treatment </p>
    <p>. Uncontrolled hypertension </p>
    <p>. Having or possible having genetic cause of CRD </p>
